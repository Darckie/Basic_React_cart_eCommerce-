ðŸš©**Note**: Due to limited time and my current learning stage in React, this project includes a simplified implementation of e-commerce functionality. As I've just started learning React, I have focused on implementing basic features. I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, and I'm confident that I'll continue learning and improving my React skills over time.
